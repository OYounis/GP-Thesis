RISC-V Architectures have been widely emerging due to RISC-V being open source and more secure. Booting Linux on a RISC-V core requires implementing RV64-IMFAC the IMFAC stands for Integer Operations, Multiply and Division, Floating Point Operations, Atomic Operation and Compressed Instructions; besides of course having a decent memory hierarchy and virtual memory. Implementing all these features and also expect to tape-out the design in just one year is not realistic. So the challenge is to make the very minimum effort to boot a simple Linux patch on AlexCore.\\

We want to launch the design of a new Linux-Capable RISC-V core from Alexandria University. This year we intended to implement the minimum features to boot a simple Linux batch without disturbing the future efforts of scaling to have more features or cores.

\section{RISC-V Compliance Tests}
in order to ensure no bugs after integrating with openpiton cache system, it provided assembly benchmarks to test all instructions, a total of 50 tests fed into the processor and successfully passed,
our job was to feed the hex generated by risc-v  cross compiler into the processor then debugging the instructions included manually through waves,fixing any bug or issue appeared after integrating until we got nearly a bug free risc-v processor with openpiton cache system.
